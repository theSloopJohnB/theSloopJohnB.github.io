	<h1>MARO PARENTS</h1>
	<section class="content">
		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>Maro Parents is a mobile app built to help parents recognize mental health challenges in their child early
			and get the support they need through easy access to a doctor and educational content written by licensed
			professionals. My team was tasked with creating an effective, intuitive way for parents to sign up, navigate
			the home screen, learn, journal, track their child’s behavior, review past entries, and navigate their
			child’s care.</p>

		<p>My role in the project involved conducting extensive user research, performing competitive and heuristic
			analysis, wireframing, conducting user testing, and prototyping to completely redesign a mobile app for
			parents on behalf of Maro, a leading EdTech organization.</p>

		<p><b>My role:</b> UX Designer</p>
		<p><b>Team: </b>I worked with three other User Experience Designers Jeanine Reeman, Drew Miller, and Melanie
			Martin</p>
		<p><b>Timeline: </b>January - April 2023</p>


		<h2>My Role</h2>

		<p>I started with a heuristic analysis to understand all the features of the app in its current state. I also
			conducted
			comparative analysis to consider how various other platforms handle the flow of similar tasks. Maro’s
			business goals
			were gaining investor support and encouraging their users to gain insights from inputting data. Key things I
			wanted
			to improve upon were the conversion rate (of free to paid users) and user engagement (number of active
			users), as
			well as limited user research that had been performed already. My primary goal was designing an app to best
			suit the
			needs and expectations of parents.</p>

		<h3>”How Might We” statement</h3>

		<p>How might we redesign the Maro Parents app to increase user engagement and gain support from investors while
			addressing scalability?</p>


		<h2>Research and Data Synthesis</h2>

		<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>

		<p>I analyzed every flow within the app, from onboarding to settings, but my key findings centered around
			identifying
			accessibility issues (such as insufficient contrast between text color and background color) and
			inconsistent
			interfaces that should be using the same components. I also identified many opportunities to incorporate
			common
			design patterns, like search functionality and other components that would improve the content browsing
			experience.

		<h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>

		<p>I analyzed a wide range of apps in a variety of spaces since Maro Parents has many different features. I
			ended up
			focusing on emulating the way that Duolingo uses gamification to keep the user engaged in learning, the way
			that Flo
			makes data entry and personalized content feel intuitive and attention-grabbing, and the way that Headspace
			uses
			delightful graphics to spark joy and teach the user about difficult topics. </p>

		<h2>User Interviews</h2>

		<p>The research phase included interviewing 6 parents, scattered geographically around the United States and
			raising
			kids between the ages of 0 and 11. My research was broad and generative but also involved targeted
			discussions
			around parents’ habits related to seeking out content, trusting apps, and tracking things about their
			children.</p>

		<p>Key Findings</p>

		<ul>
			<li> Parents believe that pediatricians and medical doctors do not know enough about mental health to
				provide
				families with the support they need. (This was mentioned by <b>5 out of 6</b> parents interviewed.)</li>

			<li>Parents seek out information through community and they are avid researchers. They especially seek out
				information when concerned about developmental milestones/health issues, to learn about parenting
				techniques,
				and for reassurance and advice. <b>5 out of 6</b> parents interviewed mentioned using an online
				community as a
				means of
				support. </li>

			<li>Parents tend to track patterns in earlier developmental stages and this becomes less frequent as their
				child
				gets older unless they have a specific concern. When they do seek out tracking tools, they look for ones
				that
				are flexible and familiar, since <b>3 out of 6</b> parents were simply using their phone’s inbuilt Notes
				app to
				track
				behaviors. </li>

			<li>Parents are highly influenced by their peers and by society. Parents tend to trust products tied to
				institutions, and they trust parenting content written by people with therapy or academic backgrounds or
				relevant lived experience. </li>

			<li>Parents want to know what their data is being used for and why their information is being requested.
				Parents do
				not mind sharing sensitive information with health professionals through patient portals. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Affinity Mapping</h2>

		<h2>User Persona</h2>

		<p>The next step was to put together a user persona based on the findings gleaned from user interviews. This
			would
			inform the app design going forward.</p>

		</div>

		<h2>Direction of Design</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>I was able to validate the driving principle behind Maro’s parenting platform. The need for early
				intervention
				and awareness around kids’ mental health was highlighted by our research finding that parents do not
				feel that
				medical doctors adequately offer the mental health support they need.</li>

			<li>I realized that a journaling feature would have to feel seamless and simple for parents to use it rather
				than
				their phone’s inbuilt Notes app.</li>

			<li>I deduced that content in the Maro Parents app should display information about who wrote it and what
				their
				background is, and it should be personalized so that data tracking and recommended content could be
				tailored to
				the users’ expressed needs, which would also necessitate a more guided and instructive onboarding
				process and
				more intuitive navigation throughout. I determined that gamification would keep users engaged with
				content so
				parents would be more likely to recommend the app to friends. I also found that users would value a
				community
				aspect in the app, so that users could find connections related to their parenting experiences.</li>

			<li>I concluded that having the option to contact a pediatrician through Maro’s mobile app would be a
				popular
				feature for parents.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>User Testing</h3>

		<p>With our user research in mind, I created low-fidelity wireframes and then conducted user testing. The
			methodology involved asking five users to sign up for the app, create a journal entry documenting data about
			their child, navigate through a module of learning material, find and filter articles about parenting, and
			submit a question for parenting experts. This process was deeply impactful and prompted numerous design
			changes, including redoing the design of the module interface, adding sub-goals and metrics related to the
			goals parents set, and adding customization options for journaling data. It also led us to make post-module
			self-reflections more interactive tools that featured additional expandable content. User responses also
			triggered a complete reconsideration of how we would integrate community sourcing into the content and how
			we would set up the navigation within the "Explore" tab.</p>
		<h3>Extra Iteration/Testing Phase</h3>

		<div class="image-container">

		</div>
		<p>After re-designing the “Explore” tab to integrate the community-sourced questions with the articles, our team
			needed an extra round of testing to validate such a major change. The new design involved adding an overlay
			within a hamburger menu so the user could navigate within the “Explore” tab. I used graphics to make clear
			that the two content types were different and filters to allow the user to segment the content types if they
			chose. The additional user testing confirmed that this new design made sense and felt familiar. </p>

		<h3>Problems Addressed by the App Redesign</h3>
		<u>Onboarding</u>
		<p>I was able to vastly improve the sign-up process, making it feel not only smooth and guided but also adding
			clarity to the questions being asked, why they were being asked, and how many steps were left in the
			process.</p>
		<u>Navigating through articles and modules</u>
		<p>Before my redesign, the user would browse articles and learning modules all together within one tab. I
			decided these two types of content should not be merged, since parents looking to learn in-depth about a
			topic are looking for something different than parents looking to browse through articles. The segmentation
			also allowed for the introduction of gamification into the "Learn" tab and the emphasis on recommended and
			community-sourced content (renamed from "Maro Talk" to "Expert FAQ" and then to "Community Sourced
			Questions", based on user feedback) in the "Explore" tab.</p>
		<u>Journaling</u>
		<p>Before, users would enter information about their child’s day one question at a time, without knowing how
			many questions were left, increasing the likelihood that parents would abandon the process. I instead put
			the data entry all on one page and replaced much of the data entry with a chip selection structure grouped
			into categories and featuring illustrative icons. I consulted with various Maro's data and health care teams
			to ensure data entry steps were optimized to fit their needs.</p>
		<u>Other improvements</u>
		<p>The design gives the user a stronger sense of the usefulness of setting goals and inputting information for
			the sake of receiving curated content recommendations. Also, we built the app using a Style Tile developed
			in coordination with the teams working on other Maro products (websites oriented towards teachers and school
			counselors), so that all three products therefore have the same strong brand identity.</p>
		<h3>Reflections</h3>
		<p><b>The design process <i>is not perfectly linear.</i></b> Even after I thought I had worked out kinks in user
			testing, I had to go back to the drawing board for how content should be structured within the “Explore”
			section of the app.</p>
		<p><b>Let constraints be a spark for creativity.</b> The Maro team informed us that they did not presently have
			the resources to devote to content moderation, which limited the ability to add community features such as
			commenting. However, I ended up implementing an elegant design solution that was perhaps better than what I
			might have come up with without real-world limitations. The focus on submitting and voting on questions lets
			users feel less alone as parents without introducing the complexities of an online forum, and embedding
			these questions among the existing article content makes this new content type easily discoverable.</p>
		<p><b>Don’t be afraid to build out the beginnings of a new aspect of an app, as long as it adds value and is
				scalable.</b> The community-sourced questions for experts added a much-demanded “community feel” to the
			app, and users responded that the author pages I designed made them find the content more trustworthy. These
			structures would be fairly simple to populate since they only involve Maro collecting writers' bios and
			creating a workflow for the writers to regularly answer community-sourced questions. I remained realistic
			and communicative with the client about what could be built within a 10-week time frame. I advised them to
			look to the future to design other features, such as adding interactive dashboards for parents to review
			journal data, building a doctor chat feature that integrates well with various Electronic Medical Records
			systems, fits with the terminology of special education plans, and complies with multiple state
			requirements. </p>
		<p><b>Don't neglect building a brand identity, but still be practical about what developers can build.</b> My
			design emphasized cute, evocative illustrations (featuring yellow, the Maro brand color) rather than relying
			on micro-interactions, avatars, and animations that developers would find hard to build and to reliably
			load. Especially since this design involved building out and improving upon so many different features, I
			wanted to ensure that incorporating brand identity and interspersing the app with colorful sparks of joy
			would not require too much heavy lifting.</p>
